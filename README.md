# Creating A Subset for A Specific Analysis-State and Homicide Rate
## Acknowledgements
This repository is created for an ENGL 105 student project at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. It is contributed to and maintained by Colin Ke, an undergraduate student at UNC-CH. Please feel free to submit an issue for feedback or questions.

## Purpose
This repository filters out NaN data for homicide rate from the dataset County Health Data 2014-2015 for better analysis. The final dataset with NaN data filtered out is in the file *df_filtered_2*. The process would be demonstrated with the County Health Data and result in the final dataset in the repository. 

The method of deriving a specific sub set and filtering out NaN data can be applied to any csv data set of interest. Doing so helps deep, specific analysis of a factor of a big data set. In this case, the homicide rate can be analyzed more efficiently using a large statistic of national county health data.

## How to use this repository
There are three files contained in the repository:

1. *CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv*, the original data set being used for analysis and demonstration
2. *df_filtered_2*, the final data set resulting from the filtering process
3. *Filter-out-NaNs*, the file with detailed instructions and all needed codes

If you would like to **check the homicide rate and its correlation with state and year between 2014 and 2015**, the *df_filtered_2* would be sufficient for you.

If you would like to **learn the filtering procedure or simply check what happened to the data set**, please check the *Filter-out-NaNs*. The instruction is written for people with little experience with coding or data processing and is very comprehensive.
